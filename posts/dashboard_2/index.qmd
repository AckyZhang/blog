<h3>Load packages and data</h3>
```{r loading-package-and-data,message = FALSE}
library(broom)
library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr)
household_data <- read.csv("household-income-us-historical_csv.csv")
```

<h3>Show the comparison between all the data</h3>

```{r comparison}
# Rearrange the columns
long_data <- pivot_longer(household_data,  cols = -c(Year, Number..thousands.), 
  names_to = "Statistic", 
  values_to = "Value")
# Visualize
ggplot(long_data, aes(x = Year, y = Value, color = Statistic, group = Statistic)) +
  geom_line() + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(title = "Comparison", x = "Year", y = "Value")
```

<h3>Calculate the highest difference between the lowest upper limit and the top 5 percent limit</h3>

```{r comparison-high-low}
# Calculate
res <- max(household_data$Top.5.percent-household_data$Lowest)
print(res)
```
